# StartAchievementProgressEffectProps

This effect indicates that the customer\'s progress in an achievement was started during  the current session. The Rule Engine creates a progress tracker for the customer,  identified by `progressTrackerId`.   This effect only starts the customer\'s progress and does not increase the progress. When this effect is returned, the customer progress status is `inprogress` and the progress value is `0`.  You can retrieve the customer\'s current progress at any time, whether or not this effect was returned, in the following ways: - Include `achievements` in the `responseContent` property of your request,   on any endpoint where this property is available, for example   [Update customer session](https://docs.talon.one/integration-api#tag/Customer-sessions/operation/updateCustomerSessionV2). - Use the [List customer\'s available achievements](https://docs.talon.one/integration-api#tag/Achievements/operation/getCustomerAchievements) endpoint. - Use the [List customer\'s achievement history](https://docs.talon.one/integration-api#tag/Achievements/operation/getCustomerAchievementHistory) endpoint.  For recurring achievements, this effect is only returned for the first iteration and has no effect on the iterations that follow. For  [recurring user-action achievements](https://docs.talon.one/docs/product/achievements/overview#recurring-user-action-achievements) specifically, this effect also begins the customer\'s progress period, specified  by the `startDate` and `endDate` properties.  This effect is triggered in the following cases:  - A rule containing a [Start customer   progress](https://docs.talon.one/docs/product/rules/effects/use-effects#start-customer-progress)   effect is validated. - A rule containing an [Update customer   progress](https://docs.talon.one/docs/product/rules/effects/use-effects#update-customer-progress)   effect is validated for an achievement that the customer has not started   yet. In this case, the Rule Engine returns the `startAchievementProgress`   effect first, followed by   [increaseAchievementProgress](https://docs.talon.one/docs/dev/integration-api/api-effects#increaseachievementprogress),   which carries the increased customer progress. Use `progressTrackerId` to   connect the results produced by the two effects.  **Note:** - This effect is not returned if the customer\'s progress in the achievement has    already started, or if the achievement\'s end date has passed. In these cases,    the **Start customer progress** effect fails, an    [error](https://docs.talon.one/docs/dev/integration-api/api-effects#error) effect   is returned, and the customer\'s progress remains unchanged. Any other effects    in the same rule are also not applied. - If a rule with this effect fails, include `ruleFailureReasons` in the    `responseContent` property of your request to see the reason for failure.    The customer\'s progress is unchanged, so no update is required. The failure    reason identifies the campaign, ruleset, and rule that failed, and `details`    explains why. - There is no rollback effect for the `startAchievementProgress` effect.

} satisfies StartAchievementProgressEffectProps

console.log(example)

// Convert the instance to a JSON string
const exampleJSON: string = JSON.stringify(example)
console.log(exampleJSON)
